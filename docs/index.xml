      <description>Modern machine learning libraries such as Jupyter, Kubeflow, PyTorch on technologies that are managed outside of the linux foundation, often forcing users to pay for cloud or hosted offerings to manage integration and tool dependencys. This challenges the ability of the ASF to continue blazing a trail of open innovation in the data science and analytics frontiers which are transforming so many businesses today. New projects in the ASF: such as Airflow, PredictionIO, SystemML, and NiFi - combined with technologies such as Spark and HDFS can be used to build an end-to-end analytics solution that is flexible and modular enough to meet the needs of modern data scientists, at pedabyte scale.</description>

      <description>Cassandra has been deployed for many years at Instagram and is still growing fast. Over the years, we’ve constantly improved the design of our infrastructure: we’ve introduced Cassandra proxy nodes to decouple the processing and storage workloads, we&amp;rsquo;ve developed Rocksandra, a new storage engine relying on RocksDB that reduced the GC pressure and improved the efficiency of our clusters. Lately, we&amp;rsquo;ve added an intermediate layer in our Cassandra infrastructure, where we could add many traffic optimizations to further improve our Cassandra clusters&#39; efficiency and reliability.</description>

      <description>In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) approaches to Natural Language Processing (NLP) drastically changed. From a feature-based modelling, where NLP tasks are tackled by using a set of manually engineered features, we moved to the so-called representation learning: text is naturally represented as a sequence of symbols (e.g., words, characters, etc.) and the role of learning how these symbols should be represented is entirely left to the ML method. Deep Learning dominates such paradigmatic shift.</description>

      <description>Open source draws its strength from the communities that use and build it. It&amp;rsquo;s their diversity of perspective, skills, and accountability that makes individual projects stronger and builds a richer and solid ecosystem. But while open source is used by the entire world, that broad user community is not yet reflected in the contributor base. In fact, diversity in open source is significantly worse than in proprietary software. While we claim that contribution is open to all, clearly not everybody feels empowered or welcome to contribute to open source projects.</description>

      <description>The Netflix media pipeline processes thousands of new shows and movies every day so that you can watch them on any device anywhere. We use a forward chaining rule engine to coordinate all of this work in multiple workflows. Hosting these workflows in a reliable, scalable and cost effective manner is a huge challenge at our scale. In this talk, we will introduce the design of Netflix’s next generation rule engine framework.</description>

      <description>At LinkedIn, we have a large and ever-expanding corpus of big data processing code written using batch processing frameworks like Pig, Hive, and Spark. These data processing pipelines produce derived data artifacts like metrics, dimensions, and features and are generally run at daily or hourly end-to-end latencies. For a subset of these artifacts, there often arises a need to produce them at a faster cadence, say minutely or even continuously. At that point, the common practice used to be that the developer would re-write the same derivation logic using a stream processing framework (Apache Samza in case of LinkedIn).</description>

      <description>Hazelcast Jet is a distributed data processing engine that threats all data as a stream. Jet is built on top of Hazelcast IMDG and thanks to this the Jet cluster can also play the role of the data source and sink. If you use Jet this way, you can achieve perfect data locality and top-of- the-class throughputs. Jet uses cooperative multithreading (comparable to green threads), it&amp;rsquo;s processors correspond to standalone single-threaded tasks that process streams of data.</description>

      <description>Cloud native application development is more than just container orchestration, when it comes to designing proper agile software architecture, there are many aspect that need to be taken into account. From simple microservices runtime, orchestration of core business, interacting with legacy, connecting with external SaaS application. To a more reactive system with events driven backbone, and also avoid data silos and how to deal with routing, versioning deployment strategy. Putting everything into a big picture, guide you through what next generation of cloud native architecture should be like and how everything works together.</description>

      <description>Kotlin is an Open Sourced, statically typed language for JVM and is mostly being favoured by Android Developers due to the many myriad features which enable more concise and cleaner code than Java without sacrificing performance or safety. By using Kotlin as our language of choice to build an apache beam pipeline, our development team not only ran into fewer errors than what we would have if we used Java; but with the help of extensively useful high level APIs present in Kotlin, we were also able to cut down on the development time required to build, test and deploy a new feature.</description>

      <description>As applications become more reliant on real-time data, streaming/messaging platforms have become more and more popular and crucial to any data pipeline. Currently, many streaming/messaging platforms are only used to access the most recent events from streams of data, however, there is tremendous value that can be unlocked if the full history of streams can be queried in an interactive fashion. Pulsar SQL is a query layer built on top of Apache Pulsar (a next-gen messaging platform), that enables users to dynamically query all streams, old and new, stored inside of Pulsar.</description>

      <description>Ride-sharing is a two-sided marketplace; balancing supply and demand with price in real time is critical to maintaining an efficient system. Dynamic pricing creates fairness for drivers (by raising rates when there is a lot of demand) and maintains good experiences for passengers (by satisfying pick-up time SLAs). This complex system makes real-time decisions using various data sources; machine learning models; and a streaming infrastructure for low latency, reliability and scalability.</description>

      <description>nIn eventually consistent systems, when a node failures or network partition occurs, we’re presented with a trade-off: to execute a request and sacrifice consistency or reject execution and sacrifice availability. In such system, quorums, overlapping node subsets guaranteeing at least one node to hold the most recent value, can be a good middle-ground. We can tolerate failures and loss of connectivity for some nodes while still serving latest results. Quorum-based replication schemes incur high storage costs: we have to store redundant values on several nodes to guarantee enough copies are going to be available in case of failure.</description>

      <description>Ballerina is the next generation programming language, which redefined what means to be &amp;lsquo;general purpose&amp;rsquo;. Historically, programming languages concentrated on single machine execution, in a controlled environment, and also for good reason, because any other external interactions were out of the scope of a programming language, at least in the bygone days that is. But now, the communication network is something that is always there, and software often doesn&amp;rsquo;t work alone.</description>

      <description>Apache Kafka, Apache Cassandra and Kubernetes are open source big data technologies enabling applications and business operations to scale massively and rapidly. While Kafka and Cassandra underpins the data layer of the stack providing capability to stream, disseminate, store and retrieve data at very low latency, Kubernetes is a container orchestration technology that helps in automated application deployment and scaling of application clusters. In this presentation, we will reveal how we architected a massive scale deployment of a streaming data pipeline with Kafka and Cassandra to cater to an example Anomaly detection application running on a Kubernetes cluster and generating and processing massive amount of events.</description>

      <description>The commercial software industry is plagued by numerous significant problems: Cost and schedule overruns, poor software quality, unrealistic expectations, products that fail to meet customer needs, and more. These problems are historic, chronic, and pervasive; they’ve been with us for decades, and changes to methodology haven’t had much effect in remedying them. By contrast, the Apache Software Foundation has been around for 20 years and the Apache Way - the framework of values and governance for Apache Software Foundation projects - has been the guiding force for dozens of highly successful software projects that are used in countless environments everywhere, run much of the Internet, and are probably used by every technical person in one way or another every day.</description>

      <description>Going back well before the ASF was formed, community has played a vital role in the development of open source software. With the formation of the ASF, we see a great example of open source community being formalized and actively facilitated. Although it can seem counterintuitive, especially to the uninitiated, placing &amp;lsquo;Community over code&amp;rsquo; helps ensure the ongoing relevance of open source as a movement, inviting individuals and organizations alike to invest in &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; software.</description>

      <description>Python is a widely used programming language that is characterized by a low barrier to entry. As many other companies in the industry, Yelp has used Python as the main programming language to implement back-end services. Unfortunately, when it comes to stream processing Python presents several challenges, including performance limitations, lack of proper multi-threading support and limited framework options.
When the use cases for more advanced stream processing started to arise, at Yelp we decided to leverage Flink and introduce a Scala/Java stack for our Data Pipeline.</description>

      <description>Apache Arrow and Apache Beam deserve to be together. It is a stated goal of both projects to provide mechanisms for performing data processing tasks across many languages. To accomplish this, both projects define a common binary “model” and provide multiple language implementations of that model.
However, they are approaching the overarching problem of cross-language data processing from two very different angles: Arrow is primarily concerned with moving columnar data across language boundaries with minimal overhead and providing optimized computation primitives to operate on that data, while Beam seeks to enable users to write scalable data pipelines in their language of choice and execute them on any distributed data-processing system.</description>

      <description>With most machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) frameworks, it can take hours to move data, and hours to train models. It&amp;rsquo;s also hard to scale, with data sets increasingly being larger than the capacity of any single server. The size of the data also makes it hard to incrementally test and retrain models in near real-time to improve results. Learn how Apache Ignite and GridGain help to address these limitations with model training and execution, and help achieve near-real-time, continuous learning.</description>

      <description>There is an increasing need to bring machine learning to a wide diversity of hardware devices from the datacenter to the edge. Current frameworks rely on vendor-specific operator libraries and optimize for a narrow range of server-class GPUs. Deploying workloads to new platforms such as mobile phones, embedded devices, and accelerators (e.g., FPGAs, ASICs) requires significant manual effort. In this talk, we will talk about Apache TVM &amp;ndash; an end to end optimizing deep compiler stack that brings deep learning models on diverse hardware back-ends that are competitive with state-of-the-art hand-tuned libraries for low-power CPU, mobile GPU, and server-class GPUs.</description>

      <description>As described in CASSANDRA-10699 (Make schema alterations strongly consistent), concurrent schema changes can still lead to schema disagreement in Cassandra 3.0. In order to properly support Elasticsearch dynamic mapping in Elassandra, we will see how multiple schema changes are validated on a working copy of the Cassandra schema, and applied in an atomic update to all nodes if a light weight transaction succeed, thus avoiding concurrent schema changes issue. I will also explain how we have taken advantage of Cassandra table extensions to store the Elasticsearch mapping directly into the CQL schema with several benefits.</description>

      <description>The data generated from IoT devices, machine logs and similar sources is often semi-structured or unstructured. This poses a challenge for traditional schema-on-write systems that require a fixed schema up-front for querying. Modern analytic applications often have ad hoc usage patterns and require tremendous flexibility over how this data can be consumed. Further, they demand that the data be made available for querying soon after it has landed in their data platform – which may be a distributed file system or NoSQL database or something similar.</description>

      <description>One of the key components in any data processing system is IO connectors. These fundamental blocks allow to read and write data, which is stored in different type of sources, in a unified and distributed way. In this sense, Apache Beam is not an exception - it provides a rich API to develop a new connector with your favorite SDK and easily integrate it with Beam runners. In this talk we are going to show you how to write your own IO connector (in Java).</description>

      <description>Apache Cassandra is a database product that is most notably known for being highly scalable and fault tolerant. Since these characteristics are something that is desirable in almost every use case, it attracts attention from developers up through executives when faced with decisions on how to architect mission critical systems. If these traits are so desirable, and Apache Cassandra makes these capabilities available to end users, then shouldn’t we use Cassandra for all our data storage needs?</description>

      <description>The AWS S3 protocol is the defacto interface for modern object stores. Ozone supports S3 protocol as the first-class notion in Ozone. For all practical purposes, a user of S3 can start using Ozone without any change to code or tools. S3 protocol support offered by Ozone is strongly consistent, so users don’t need to run sidekick tools like S3Guard when running big data applications like Apache Spark, Apache YARN or Apache Hive.</description>

      <guid>https://elek.github.io/acah2021/sessions/1181.html</guid>
      <description>In​ the analysis of b​ig data there are often problem queries that don’t scale because they require huge compute resources to generate exact results, or don’t parallelize well. Examples include c​ount-distinct, ​quantiles, most frequent items, joins, matrix computations, and graph analysis. Algorithms that can produce accuracy guaranteed approximate answers for these problem queries are a required toolkit for modern analysis systems that need to process massive amounts of data​ quickly. For interactive queries there may not be other viable alternatives, and in the case of real­-time streams, these specialized algorithms, called stochastic, s​treaming, sublinear algorithms,​ or &amp;lsquo;s​ketches&amp;rsquo;,​ are the only known solution.</description>

      <description>Every Cassandra operator has been hit with a couple of weird/complex cases that don&amp;rsquo;t fit the normal expected failure situation. It can be a problem in hardware, software, networking, operator mistake, or a mix of it all. In this talk we will go through a compilation of such cases that we faced. How do they appear, how did we debug them and how did we fix them. We expect this to be a walk through weird, fun cases and sharing knowledge on the situations and on the fixing of such problems</description>

      <description>As a mature operational database with a 10+ year history as an Apache project, Cassandra has a long history with many twists and turns. In this talk, we’ll look at common misgivings and misunderstandings that we encounter in conversations with developers and get to the bottom of the story:
 Cassandra is a “columnar” (or “column-oriented”) database. Porting my relational data model to Cassandra will work well. Cassandra is a niche database that is only good for narrow set of use cases.</description>

      <description>Apache Beam provides a unified programming model to execute batch and streaming pipelines on all the popular big data engines. The translation layer from Beam to the chosen big data engine is called a runner. The current runner for Apache Spark is based on the RDD/DStream framework. However, there is an ongoing work to move it to Spark next generation framework a.k.a structured streaming. This talk will present why structured streaming is a good fit for Apache Beam, why it is worth the effort, and will give some feedback on how Apache Beam has solved the challenge, what the tough points and the sweet points were.</description>

      <description>The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model for storing graph data. While the standard was initially created for storing meta-data about the World Wide Web, its flexible format made it a popular choice for storing many different types of information. With the explosive increase in the size of available data, scalable solutions are needed to efficiently store and query very large RDF graphs within big data architectures. Apache Rya (incubating) is a scalable database management system designed for storing and searching very large RDF data.</description>

      <description>IoT is widely spreading in various industries, and various sensor devices generate large amounts of data in real-time. Such big data is used for visualization, machine learning, and other data analysis. Kudu is one of the data stores for such use cases which require fast inserts and efficient scans. Apache HBase is also often used to handle time series data such as sensor data. We also evaluated HBase for smart meter data a few years ago.</description>

      <description>What is the difference between the ASF Tomcat distribution and the various flavors of tomcat packages on Linux? Most users don’t know! In this discussion Coty will explain how the tomcat packages distributed by a couple flavors of Linux (Red Hat and Debian/Ubuntu) are structured and why the container is provided that way. Coty also hopes to get feedback from the audience and to discuss how these Linux distributions can better provide tomcat to users.</description>

      <title>Schema-Controlled HDFS Column Encryption and Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://elek.github.io/acah2021/sessions/1132.html</link>

      <guid>https://elek.github.io/acah2021/sessions/1132.html</guid>
      <description>Motivation: Access control via encryption improves security coverage compared with traditional enforcement in the access path because encryption can prevent invalid accesses from any angle. Finer-grained access control at the column-level is needed because in a typical big dataset, only a few columns are sensitive and need to be protected, and different columns could have different sensitivities and a different set of eligible readers. Design: With encryption features in columnar file format like Apache Parquet, column access control via encryption becomes possible.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Apache Drill has some very surprising characteristics and, more importantly, it enables Drill users to do some surprising things. It’s no longer surprising to be able to do standard SQL in a highly distributed and large scale system - there is an entire class of modern tools that do this including Apache Hive, Presto or Spark SQL. But Drill has other capabilities that are surprising and make it stand apart from its class.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Ingesting lots of data isn’t very hard any more. Ingesting it on a critical schedule, within strict time bounds while minimizing the risk of bogus data showing up is much harder. In practice, grownup data ingestion and access requires the following capabilities * Incoming data can be fully ingested into our working dataset but hidden from users until all quality checks are completedn * Individual batches of data can be released atomicallyn * Any indexing updates should also appear appear atomicallyn * Expiring data should disappear atomically either according to ingest batch or precise time bounds Apache Drill provides several capabilities that make it much easier to meet these goals.</description>

      <description>Apache Spark is the most popular open source analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark is not only a mature system, but thanks to its support of multiple resource managers like Hadoop, Mesos, and Kubernetes it has become a popular choice for both batch and streaming workloads in the industry. Apache Beam has included a Spark runner since its inception to allow users to execute Beam pipelines on Spark, but until recently the Spark runner could only execute pipelines written in Java.</description>

      <description>The Apache TinkerPop team is working on the next major version of the project &amp;ndash; TinkerPop4. TinkerPop4 advances the technology developed in TinkerPop3 with a new virtual machine architecture that enables any query language to control any processing engine manipulating any data structure. A query language can support a compiler to TinkerPop4&amp;rsquo;s Turing Complete bytecode specification. Compiled bytecode is then translated into an intermediate functional representation that an integrated processing engine will ultimately transform into a processor-specific execution plan.</description>

      <description>Cassandra cluster management is hard. Understanding how your Cassandra data model will hold up in production over a period of time can be tricky. If that is not tough enough, understanding how a change to a Cassandra setting will affect your cluster can be be difficult. Knowing how your data model or setting change will perform under a production data load can prevent performance degradation or worse nodes going down. In the last year, The Last Pickle has invested the time to develop the tooling necessary to create test clusters in AWS, as well as a scalable stress tool which can run pre-configured workloads.</description>

      <description>There is a chance of system, storage and network failures in the CloudStack environment at any point of time, which is unknown to the end users and administrators. The administrators are highly depend on the alert and monitoring system to raise an alarm on failures, upon the action is being taken. This can down the operations and will impact the end user services. The prediction of such failures ahead in CloudStack environment would be required instead of depending on the monitoring systems.</description>

      <description>This session will re-evaluate Cassandra’s relationship with runtime and build systems, pointing out ways that the existing systems fall down, and identifying avenues for improvement. Over the past few years, a number of platforms have emerged for running user code. Container runtimes like Docker, container orchestrators such as Kubernetes, and metrics collections agents like Prometheus and Spectator have all gained popularity and mind-share. Cassandra functionality such as metrics, bootstrapping, and monitoring integrates with the newer paradigms, but in an ad-hoc and improvised fashion.</description>

      <description>Hadoop was born much earlier than the Cloud Native era. But the question is still the same: what can it offer in the time of Kubernetes, containerization and hybrid clouds? Apache Hadoop Ozone is a new subproject of Hadoop. It is based a generic low-level binary layer, the Hadoop Distributed Data Storage (HDDS) and a S3 compatible Object Store implementation on top of it. The separation of the data storage layer has multiple benefits: it can help to solve the “small files problem” and increase the scalability of the Hadoop storage clusters but it also helps us to provide access to the same data via multiple interfaces.</description>

Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s time for a little UI and UX help? At the very least some documentation! Next, how is anyone else going to find what you&amp;rsquo;ve created? And that&amp;rsquo;s only the beginning. Ruth Suehle, manager of Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s Open Source and Standards community leadership team, will take you through examples of the best and the worst, from projects large and small, to help you see what you need beyond your code to build a successful open source project and community.</description>

      <description>Interactive applications are replacing traditional reporting interfaces as the preferred means for organizations to derive value from their datasets. An interactive user experience requires latency on the order of milliseconds. Cluster computing frameworks such as Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark are tremendously beneficial in processing and deriving insights from data. However, high query latency makes these frameworks sub-optimal for interactive applications. Alternatively, the use of relational databases and key/value stores as dedicated query layers can reduce latency, but these approaches suffer many drawbacks for analytic use cases.</description>

      <description>nExisting CloudStack supports legacy boot loader BIOS by default for Guest VM’s booting on Hypervisor(XEN, VMware, KVM etc). In Virtualization, hypervisor emulates the hardware for the Guest VM. BIOS {Basic Input-Output system} is a low-level software. The BIOS loads when a VM starts up, and the BIOS is responsible for waking up your VM’s hardware(emulated) components, ensures they are functioning properly, and then runs the boot loader that boots Windows or whatever other operating system have installed.</description>

      <description>Industrial IoT is made up of many different programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that communicate with often incompatible and proprietary data formats. Apache PLC4X standardizes access to these PLCs by creating a set of libraries across a variety of languages to read and write PLC data with a unified API. Unfortunately, developing and maintaining support for these different data formats, especially across multiple languages, can be burdensome. In this talk we discuss how we can describe PLC data using the open standard Data Format Description Language (DFDL), how Apache Daffodil uses these descriptions to transform data to a standard and easily consumable representation, and an approach to extend PLC4X to use Daffodil and DFDL descriptions to reduce the effort needed to support a variety of PLCs and languages.</description>

      <description>Out of the box, Apache Tomcat is quite secure. Then you need to configure it to suit your environment, connect your data sources, and deploy your applications. Those processes can potentially reduce the security of the entire system. A thorough review of your host, network, application and configuration is necessary to identify those areas where your security needs improvement. We’ll discuss each of these areas in some detail and how some simple tweaks and tools can make you and your users safer.</description>

      <description>(Cassandra NGCC) Apache Cassandra on-disk storage model is based on immutable SSTables that are, depending on the compaction strategy, optimized for some general use cases. The main issue with optimally reading on-disk data is that a single partition data most of the time needs to be fetched from multiple partitions. None of the existing compaction strategies are optimized to provide a single file read guarantees on cold data. Partition based compaction strategy addresses that issue with effectively compacting all data that belongs to a single partition into the same SSTable.</description>

      <description>As distributed applications grow more complex, dynamic, and massively scalable, “observability” becomes more critical. Observability is the practice of using metrics, monitoring and distributed tracing to understand how a system works. In this presentation we’ll explore two complementary Open Source technologies: Prometheus for monitoring application metrics; and OpenTracing and Jaeger for distributed tracing. We’ll discover how they improve the observability of a massively scalable Anomaly Detection system - an application which is built around Apache Cassandra and Apache Kafka for the data layers, and dynamically deployed and scaled on Kubernetes, a container orchestration technology.</description>

      <guid>https://elek.github.io/acah2021/sessions/1145.html</guid>
      <description>Increasingly static site generators are being used to create a presence on the web, both for the speed and simplicity of the resulting static pages. A related trend is the use of &amp;lsquo;clean&amp;rsquo; URLs with no resource name extensions, such as /products/mousetrap instead of /products/mousetrap.html. Clean URLs are more memorable, less fragile, do not leak implementation information, and are more search engine friendly. Because the default Tomcat implementation determines MIME type by filename extension, &amp;lsquo;clean&amp;rsquo; filenames are traditionally produced by servlet mapping or URL rewriting, perhaps coupled with Apache HTTP Server in front of Tomcat using mod_rewrite.</description>

      <title>Wire Encryption In HDFS: Protect Your Data From Others, Not Yourself</title>

      <guid>https://elek.github.io/acah2021/sessions/1175.html</guid>
      <description>Wire data encryption is a key component of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). HDFS can enforce different levels of data protection, allowing users to specify one based on their own needs. However, such enforcement comes in as an all-or-nothing feature. Namely, wire encryption is enforced either for all accesses or none. Since encryption bears a considerable performance cost, the all-or-nothing condition forces users to choose between &amp;lsquo;faster but unencrypted&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;encrypted but slower&amp;rsquo; for all clients.</description>

      <description>Apache Hudi is a newly incubating project at the ASF. Originally created at Uber, to power it’s vast big data lake, Hudi provides key features like atomic writes, snapshot isolation, incremental views, rollbacks, point-in-time restores, file size management &amp;amp; many more. To date, the big data community has been polarized amongst batch and streaming systems, when balancing data freshness and scale. Hudi also addresses a combined need for speed and scale, that does not naturally fit into existing batch and streaming data processing architectures, by way of ability to support continuous ingestion and asynchronous compaction of row &amp;amp; columnar data.</description>

      <description>At Comcast we have a unique challenge of serving both static and live linear content via our CDN. In general a thundering herd (multiple instantaneous simultaneous requests for the same content) is not a large concern for static files barring a few situations like serving automatic pushed update files. However when serving live content the nature of it means you are almost always generating a herd or on the verge of it due to timing.</description>

      <description>The Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt initiative has changed the landscape for online security. The capital cost of cryptographic security for every web site worldwide has been lowered from potentially thousands of dollars per year to zero. One of the trade-offs for the availability of these free certificates is that they are short-lived, making automated deployment of certificates an essential piece of any deployment plan. Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt supports Apache httpd out of the box for single-command renewal and deployment on a single host, while with Tomcat it&amp;rsquo;s more complicated.</description>

      <description>Twitter&amp;rsquo;s on premise HDFS clusters are scaled out to handle hundreds of petabyte data serving thousands of developers every day. Managing such large scale data introduces several challenges. Organization, discovery, data life cycle, replication, schema management and many more questions needs to be answered at scale. Our data infrastructure is built on different open source and in house projects working together to solve this problem. While we extend our data to cloud, we had to solve similar challenges on cloud environment at Twitter scale.</description>

      <description>Cassandra users with general purpose workloads typically must choose the lesser of two evils between the default “write optimized” Size Tiered Compaction Strategy (STCS) and the “read optimized” Leveled Compaction Strategy (LCS). It is typical these days to hear “use LCS unless it explodes, in which case use STCS…unless that explodes, in which case you are out of luck”. I believe that by taking what we as a community learned from the development and real world deployment of LCS, we can create a next generation compaction strategy which offers all of the benefits of LCS with few of the drawbacks.</description>

      <description>Observability is quite important for the cloud native application. Itncould be a challenge if we build up the system observer from thenstrache. By leveraging the Skywalking&amp;rsquo;s extension mechanism, we couldnsend out the data to the backend directly to improve thenObservability of the Cloud Native Service. In distributed applications, horizontal sharding and transactio coordination are most popular solutions. Observability for businessninvocation on sharding scenario are not enough; but observer allnsharded details of backend infrastructures indifferently are tooncomplicated.</description>

      <description>Optimizing scheduling and communication behaviors of big data pipelines for resource and data characteristics is crucial for achieving high performance. For example, optimizing for geographically-distributed resources, cheap transient resources, disk-based large data shuffle, and skewed data have recently received a lot of interest and attention. The new incubating Apache Nemo project aims to make it easy to express and enforce such optimizations by providing a policy interface that transforms an intermediate representation (IR) of data processing applications.</description>

      <description>Failures are inevitable. But when they occur, our goal should be to resolve them as quickly and efficiently as possible. PagerDuty has developed an open-source Incident Response framework based on the Incident Command System (ICS). That product-independent process has helped many organizations set up Incident Response processes that resolve technical issues as quickly and effectively as possible. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of documentation you can follow, but how do incidents actually play out in real-time when they happen?</description>

      <description>This session discusses end-to-end use cases such as connected cars, smart home or healthcare sensors where you integrate IoT devices with enterprise IT using open source technologies and standards. MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol for Internet of Things (IoT). However, MQTT is not built for high scalability, longer storage or easy integration to legacy systems. Apache Kafka is a highly scalable distributed streaming platform, which ingests, stores, processes and forwards high volumes of data from thousands of IoT devices.</description>

      <description>At Netflix, we manage petabytes of data in Apache Cassandra which must be reliably accessible to users in mere milliseconds. To achieve this, we have built sophisticated control planes that turn our persistence layer based on Apache Cassandra into a truly self-driving system. We will start with the user interface that Netflix developers use to interact with their Cassandra databases and dive deep into the automation that powers it all. From cluster creation, through scaling up, to cluster death, complex automation drives large fleets of virtual machines hosted on the AWS cloud.</description>

      <guid>https://elek.github.io/acah2021/sessions/1173.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lsquo;We will talk about our open source work - YuniKorn scheduler project (Y for YARN, K for K8s, uni- for Unified) brings long-wanted features such as hierarchical queues, fairness between users/jobs/queues, preemption to Kubernetes; and it brings service scheduling enhancements to YARN. Any improvements to this scheduler can benefit both Kubernetes and YARN community. Abstract: YARN schedulers are optimized for high-throughput, multi-tenant batch workloads. It can scale up to 50k nodes per cluster, and schedule 20k containers per second; On the other side, Kubernetes schedulers are optimized for long-running services, but many features like hierarchical queues, fairness resource sharing, and preemption etc, are either missing or not mature enough at this point of time.</description>

      <description>Apache Edgent (formerly Quarks) is a Project in the Apache Incubator since early 2016. The main focus of the project is to simplify edge processing pipelines. Through the last year it went a bit silent around the project and although the topic is hotter than ever the project lost its drive and went into hibernation. With the rise of other projects in the (industrial) IoT ecosystem like Apache PLC4X and Apache IoTDB there are a lot of new use cases and applications for edge processing, especially in the field of industrial IoT thus, a group of contributors from other IoT related projects has gathered to bring the project back to life and on track.</description>

      <description>In many places, we&amp;rsquo;re told to &amp;lsquo;leave our emotions out of it,&amp;rsquo; in our work, and in our other technical endeavors, including in open source communities. But that is an irrational, dangerously naïve point of view, one that often leads us to not concern ourselves with the feelings of others, thereby allowing biases (intended or not) to come into play. This harms our communities, by excluding valuable contributors, and their skills and ideas.</description>

Marketplace Forecasting builds and deploys ML algorithms to handle the immense coordination, hyperlocal decision making, and learning needed to tackle the enormous scale and movement of our transportation network. In order for our decision engines to be future-aware, we need to be able to “see into the future” as accurately as possible across both space and time. In Uber, we use H3 (a hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system) to partition the data geospatially.</description>

      <description>The Apache Commons Project is home to one of the more widely consumed Java utility functions, namely “StringUtils.isBlank(String str);”. But when you look beyond commons-lang, you’ll find a wide array of heavily utilized and extremely useful tools. For example, commons-cli is the command line parser used by the Apache Maven project; commons-fileupload is heavily used by both Apache Tomcat and Apache Struts; commons-text is heavily used by Apache Hadoop; and commons-dbcp is a database connection pool used across Tomcat as well as the Spring Framework.</description>

      <description>he business value of data decreases rapidly after it is created, particularly in use cases such as fraud prevention, cybersecurity, and real-time system monitoring. The high-volume, high-velocity datasets used to feed these use cases often contain valuable, but perishable, insights that must be acted upon immediately. In order to maximize the value of their data enterprises must fundamentally change their approach to processing real-time data to focusing reducing their decision latency on the perishable insights that exist within their real-time data streams.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt is a free, automated certificate authority (CA) which is open for use to anyone who owns a domain name. Using Traffic Router as the DNS, we have integrated with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt when utilizing HTTPS on the delivery service domains. Many open source projects provide libraries to ease implementation of Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt, and for this project we used go-acme/lego (MIT licensed) to integrate with the Traffic Ops Golang API. Integration with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt provides many advantages including saving money by using a completely free CA, saving time with automation including certificate renewal, and improving reliability by eliminating manual intervention for certificate generation and deployment.</description>

In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover what it&amp;rsquo;s like developing IoT projects.</description>
